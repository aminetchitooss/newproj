# Node Simple Repo 

> This a simple repo about starter notions of nodeJs. 

> This includes node Core modules examples
such as  events, FS (file system), http, OS (operating system)
 and installing dev dependecies like nodemon.

> Using those core modules in a web Server app (Interface and Api)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000 without nodemon
npm start

# Serve on localhost:3000 with nodemon
npm run dev 
```
